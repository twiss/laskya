Laskya
======

Laskya is a calculator written in javascript. Laskya is mainly meant for daily calculations that you might otherwise use windows calculator, google, wolfram|alpha or something similar for. The main design goals are:

- User-friendly
- Fast

Laskya is alpha software, so the language and API *will* change.

See doc/repl.md for an intro to the language, and doc/api.md for an intro to the API.


Installation of the REPL
------------------------

- Clone this repo
- Install [node](http://nodejs.org/)
- run `npm install -g` (`-g` means global)

Now you can run `laskya` anywhere.
