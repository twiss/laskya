Laskya
======

Laskya is a calculator written in javascript. Laskya is mainly meant for daily calculations that you might otherwise use windows calculator, google, wolfram|alpha or something similar for. The main design goals are:

- User-friendly
- Fast

Laskya is alpha software, so the language and API *will* change.

See doc/repl.md for an intro to the language, and doc/api.md for an intro to the API.
